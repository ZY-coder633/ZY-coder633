## ðŸŽ¯ About Me  

- ðŸ”­ Focused on building scalable systems and optimizing databases.  
- ðŸŒ± Passionate about full-stack web development and system programming.  
- ðŸŽ“ Currently pursuing a Master's in Information Systems at Northeastern University.  

## ðŸ’» Technical Skills  

**Languages**: C, C++, Rust, Python, Java, JavaScript, SQL  
**Web Development**: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, React, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js  
**Databases**: MySQL, MongoDB, Neo4j  
**Tools**: Git, NPM, Linux, Unit Testing, Performance Analysis  

## ðŸš€ Projects  

### [Rust SQL Database](https://github.com/YZhao-prog/Rust-SQL-Database) | Rust, SQL | Sep 2024 â€“ Present  
- **Lexer and Parser**: Developed an integrated lexer and parser to tokenize SQL statements and generate abstract syntax trees (ASTs).  
- **Query Planner and Executor**: Designed a query planner that transformed ASTs into optimized physical execution plans and implemented a multi-stage executor for efficient query execution.  
- **Storage Mechanisms**: Leveraged Rustâ€™s `BTreeMap` for in-memory storage and implemented a Bitcask-based disk storage system for persistence, ensuring high-performance data insertion and retrieval.  
- **Storage Engines and SQL Support**: Built both in-memory and disk-backed storage engines with support for essential SQL commands, optimizing for query performance and scalability.  

### Operating System Kernel Based on RISC-V ISA | C, C++, RISC-V | May 2024 â€“ Jul 2024  
- **Memory Management**: Modified virtual memory and page table mechanisms for efficient user-kernel data transfers, implementing lazy allocation and copy-on-write using page faults.  
- **Process Management**: Studied xv6 process scheduling and thread switching, implementing user-mode coroutines and optimizing locking mechanisms to reduce race conditions.  
- **File System Improvements**: Increased single file size limit from 268KB to 65803KB, implemented symbolic links, and developed memory-mapped files to reduce disk access.  
- **System Calls and Interrupts**: Added new system calls and implemented an alarm system call using internal interrupt handling.  

### Scalable and Concurrent Database Kernel | C++, SQL | Sep 2023 â€“ Dec 2023  
- **Low-Level**: Developed a Buffer Pool using scalable hash tables and LRU-K, implementing page scheduling functionality within the Buffer Pool.  
- **Mid-Level**: Built non-clustered indexes and iterator capabilities with B+ trees, using independent read-write locks for safe and efficient multi-threaded access.  
- **Execution Layer**: Implemented transaction execution for various statements (SELECT, INSERT, GROUP BY, JOIN) using the Volcano Model.  
- **Global Concurrency Control**: Designed a lock manager based on a two-phase locking protocol, supporting three isolation levels.
